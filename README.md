This repository contains models, simulations, and measurement scripts for the method of polarimetry using stress-engineered optics (SEOs) developed by the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY. The purpose of these modules are to compliment the development of a working polarimeter in optical astronomy at the University of Denver in Denver, CO.
